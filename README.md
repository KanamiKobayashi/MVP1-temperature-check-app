# MVP_1
This health check app is for kids cheerleading team in Japan filling in COVID forms.

Due to COVID situation, they must check in all players' temperature for 2 weeks before attending the competition. 
I am developing this app to allow them save time (instead of manual recording way) and focus on practice their performance.

This app users are the parents of players and the coaches working for Japanese cheerleading association.

This is MVP_1 version.
