# MVP_1
This health check app is for my friend's kids cheerleading team in Japan.

Due to covid situation, they must check all players temperature for 2 weeks everyday before attending the competition. 
I am creating this app to allow them to save significant amount of time to record their health.

This app users are the parents of the player and the coach.

This is MVP_1.
