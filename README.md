# MVP_1
This health check app is for my friend's kids cheerleading team in Japan to filling in COVID forms.

Due to COVID situation, they must check all players temperatures for 2 weeks before attending the competition. 
I am creating this app to allow them to save significant amount of time to record their health instead of manual way and focus on practicinge their performance.

This app users are the parents of players and the coaches.

This is MVP_1.
